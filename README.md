IPL 1st Inning Score Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the score of the first inning of an IPL match. It uses a regression approach and analyzes ball-by-ball information of matches played between IPL teams from Season 1 to 10 (2008 to 2017).

Dataset
The dataset contains detailed ball-by-ball information for IPL matches and is available for download on Kaggle:
IPL Dataset (Season 2008-2017).

Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Platform: Jupyter Notebook (Colab integration with Google Drive)
Project Workflow
Data Collection:
The dataset is imported from Kaggle and stored in Google Drive for use in Colab.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
Feature engineering to create meaningful input for the regression model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing key statistics and trends in the data.
Identifying patterns that affect first-inning scores.
Model Building:

Using regression techniques to predict first-inning scores.
Tuning hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
Evaluation:

Assessing model accuracy using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².
Visualizing predictions vs actual scores.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the .ipynb file.
Ensure the dataset (ipl_colab.csv) is in the specified location (e.g., Google Drive).
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to mount Google Drive, load the dataset, and run the code cells.
Results
Predicts IPL first-inning scores based on historical data with high accuracy.
Helps analyze performance trends for teams and players.
Future Scope
Extend the model to include second-inning predictions.
Integrate additional features like weather, venue, or player form.
Deploy the model as a web app for wider accessibility.
